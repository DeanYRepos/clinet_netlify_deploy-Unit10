Final Tech degree Project: Full Stack App with React and REST API

Project Overview:
 I used React to create a client side for an existing school database REST API (that was created in a previous project). This full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users will be able to call from a database, retrieving a list of courses, details from those courses, as well as being able to create, update and delete said courses in the database.

The application will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes (create, update, delete) to the courses in the database.

This project uses React, React hooks, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up the initial project:

I implemented JavaScript, JSX, React hooks to build out the components of the application. I used React Router to set up and navigate routes. Used the Fetch API to fetch data from the REST API to allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in and access to the correct courses.
